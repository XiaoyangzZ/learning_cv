### Projects

Train a binary classifier to distinguish between images of shoes you like and shoes you don't like. (Warning: this will require you to find many pictures of shoes.)

Train a digit classifier on the MNIST database (publically available online.) 


## Segmentation

### Projects
https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/ - train to recognize your family's faces

## SLAM
### References
ORB-SLAM. One of the best algorithms out there. http://webdiis.unizar.es/~raulmur/orbslam/


### Projects
This is tricky - SLAM is usually a large compilation of algorithms. Get one of the following parts to work:

Optical flow

Feature matching between frames

Get orb-slam running with a webcam. See if you can make it better.
